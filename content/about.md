Hi, I’m Rishul Bangar, a Architectural & Hospitality Photographer and Marketing Consultant based in Mumbai, India.
</br></br>
Over the past 8 years, I have photographed 500+ hospitality projects across India, the United States, and Africa. Beyond photography, I specialize in visual storytelling through short-form videos such as Reels. With over 40,000 followers on Instagram, I have helped my clients gain millions of views on their content, elevating their digital presence.
</br></br>
I hold a Bachelor's degree in Architecture from LS Raheja School of Architecture and a Master’s in Management in Hospitality from Cornell University. Before starting my own practice, I served as the General Manager of Brand Strategy & Marketing at StayVista, South Asia’s largest chain of boutique and luxury holiday homes. In this role, I led a creative team of 15 individuals and collaborated with 20+ freelancers. I oversaw 1,000+ photoshoots, grew our Instagram page from 30K to 600K followers, and achieved over 4 million monthly organic users. My work earned three national awards, including "Best Social Media Brand - Hospitality."
</br></br>
My love for photography began with capturing wildlife, and I still hold a deep passion for documenting animals in their natural habitat, from snow leopards in the Himalayas to cheetahs in the African savannah.
</br></br>
Let’s connect and create compelling visual stories that leave a lasting impact!
