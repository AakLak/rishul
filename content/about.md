    <div class="col-12 col-md-8">In my final year of studying Architecture, I was awarded Best Student - yet, ironically, instead of the usual gift of a book related to the field, my professors gave me a book about photography.
    </br></br>
    I am an Architectural and Commercial Photographer based in Mumbai, Maharashtra. Photography has been an integral of my life for years now. I had learned how to use a DSLR manually before I owned a cell phone. After completing my foundation course in photography from FX School in Mumbai, I pursued my Bachelors in Architecture from L. S. Raheja School of Architecture in Mumbai.

    My initial muse was wildlife, but soon, owing to my study of architecture, I developed a keener interest in shooting built spaces. Over time I began to assimilate knowledge on the art of making an image stand out in the busy digital world. As of today, I have shot over a hundred properties for various clients, including some award-winning projects.</div>
