    <div class="col-12 col-md-8">Hi, I’m Rishul B, an Architect and Architectural Photographer based in Mumbai, India.
    </br></br>
    I am currently working as the Manager of Photography and Visual Content at Vista Rooms, South Asia’s largest chain of boutique and luxury holiday homes. My job involves managing an in-house team along with 20+ freelance photographers while photographing properties myself.
    </br></br>
   I have shot over 150+ holiday homes across India, along with freelance assignments ranging from real estate, hospitality, interiors, and products. As an architect, I have designed Mumbai's first outdoor photography studio: Sets in the City, working on 25 different sets themed on countries from across the world. 
   </br></br>
   My love for photography started by photographing wildlife, and I still possess a keen interest in documenting wildlife in their natural habitat.
